- 👋 Hi, I’m CJ a lapsed coder now trying to get back into projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, natural language processing and web dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python using the Angela Yu 100 Days of Python, data science on Coursera and Datacamp, and react with Flavio Copes
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's fairly simple. I'm trying to get myself back to match fitness having not coded much in the past ten years,
- 📫 You can find me @falsestartcoder on Twitter.
