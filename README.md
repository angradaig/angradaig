- 👋 Hi, I’m CJ a lapsed coder now trying to get back into projects.  I'm based in the cathedral city of Norwich in the UK.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, natural language processing and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python using the Angela Yu 100 Days of Python, data science on Coursera and Datacamp, and React and Javascript with the Flavio Copes bootcamp
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's fairly simple. I'm trying to get myself back to match fitness having not coded much in the past ten years. I think I should be ready to work professionally by September 2022.
- 📫 You can find me @falsestartcoder on Twitter.
